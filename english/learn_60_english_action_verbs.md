Let's start by talking about the eyes. When you go to bed at night, you close your eyes so that you can fall asleep. In the morning when you wake up you open your eyes so that you can see. During the day you blink a lot I'm not sure exactly how many times and you don't even need to think about it, you just blink to keep your eyes moist. If someone does something you don't like you might stare at them that means you just keep looking at them directly for a long time and of course there's a couple other things you can cover your eyes or you might tell a child to cover their eyes so they don't see something that they're not supposed to and if you like someone you might wink at them i'm not very good at winking i can do it with this eye i have trouble doing it with that eye so you might be wondering is there anything you can do with your whole head well there's two things actually if you agree with someone you can nod and if you disagree with someone you can shake your head a nod or to nod means yes and if you shake your head it means no so what kind of actions can you do with your nose well little kids and adults sometimes will pick their nose they'll put their finger in their nose i'm not actually doing it by the way and they'll pick their nose sometimes when you are not feeling well you need to blow your nose i'm not actually going to do it because i don't need to and if you're sick you will sometimes sneeze ah you can also use your nose to sniff maybe before you plug your nose you sniff and you smell something that doesn't smell very good and if you're good at it you can wiggle your nose it's kind of hard for me to do hi let's talk a little bit about the mouth there are a lot of things that you can do with the mouth obviously you can talk and you can speak with your mouth and you can also whistle like i was just doing you can also sing with your mouth that's about as much singing as you're probably going to hear from me you can also whisper with your mouth so if you want to talk really quietly to someone you might whisper to them another thing you might do with your mouth is hum maybe you don't like to sing and you don't like to whistle maybe you like to hum [Music] another thing you might do with your mouth is kiss i'm not going to kiss jen right now but i'll demonstrate using my hand so you can also use your mouth to give someone a kiss obviously when you're eating food you're going to use your mouth to chew and if you're not feeling well you will probably cough we used to cover our mouth when we coughed we used to go but now we're supposed to cough into our elbow and of course how could i forget when you have an ice cream cone you can lick the ice cream that's really good ice cream let's talk about the ears if you are somewhere really loud you might plug your ears or you might cover your ears those are two things you can do if you're somewhere where it's really loud when i was a kid my grandmother used to pull on my ears when i was bad that wasn't very nice and the last thing you can do is if you are having trouble hearing someone you can cup your ear so when you cup your ear with your hand it makes it easier to hear somebody so let's talk a little bit about the hands there are a few things you can do with your hands that aren't very nice you can pinch someone that's when you grab their skin like this it's not very nice when you do this but you can pinch someone you can poke someone with your finger you can poke someone if you have a question you can say excuse me sir i have a question you can punch someone it's not very nice to punch someone but if you watch a boxing match you will see them punch each other and you could slap someone i did this in my video last week when i was pretending there was a mosquito on me so you can pinch punch poke or slap in the winter in canada sometimes the doors to our vehicles freeze shut and you need to yank on the door to get it open that means you need to pull really hard on it we also have another verb to tug you have to tug on the door to get it open this one's frozen shut when you pull on something you're trying to make it come towards you when you pull it when you push on something you're trying to make it go away from you remember when i was a little kid my dad taught me how to snap my fingers when you snap your fingers makes a really cool sound we can also use our fingers to flick things so if a mosquito landed on me i could flick it away we use our fingers to point so if i wanted you to go over there i could point over there to let you know which way to go and we also use our fingers to make really bad gestures but i'm not going to show you which gesture i'm making here because it's not a very nice one speaking of mosquitoes if there were mosquitoes flying around me right now i could swat them when you do this with your hands you are swatting we also when we really like a performance we'll clap it's also called applause it's always nice to clap your hands when someone does a good job playing music or performing in a play the other thing we use our hands for is we used to shake hands with people but now we actually bump elbows shaking hands is no longer considered to be a good thing to do because it spreads disease so now we bump elbows hey how are you doing when you see someone you know you sometimes wave to them and there's a few other things that you do with your hands that i need to explain as well sometimes you will tickle someone if it's someone you know really well or a little kid you might tickle them that's when you kind of do this with your hand and it makes them giggle i am a very ticklish person i do not like to be tickled the other thing you can do with your hand is you can rub when you do this with your hand you are rubbing this is to rub and the other thing you can do is squeeze so when you grab something like this like my arm i can grab it and then squeeze my arm oscar likes it when i pet him and that's one more thing you can do with your hands if you're somewhere where there's really good loud music you can dance i think this is the first time i'm dancing in a video if you don't know something you can use your shoulders to shrug if the teacher asks you a question and you don't know the answer you can just say i don't know the other thing you can do that rhymes with shrug is hug that's when you go like this to someone and you just put your arms around them so that they know that you like them let's talk about the difference between to trip and to slip if i was walking along and there was something like this brick here i might trip on it so when you trip on something it means you walk into it if however there was some ice here and i was walking along and i slipped on it that would be how you use the verb to slip so to trip means you walk into something to slip means you're on something slippery another action you can do is you can jump or if you want you can go on one foot and you can hop and try not to fall over you can also squat and look at something on the ground and if you're playing a game like soccer you can kick the ball i'm pretty sure you already know the verb to run and to walk but we also have the verb to tiptoe when you tiptoe you walk really carefully and quietly so people won't hear you sometimes little kids will also skip it looks like this i did it earlier hey bob the canadian here thank you so much for watching this english lesson where i hope you were able to learn a few more
